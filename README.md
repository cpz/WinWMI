[![Sponsor](https://img.shields.io/badge/ðŸ’œ-sponsor-blueviolet)](https://github.com/sponsors/cpz)

A simple one header solution to interacting with [Windows WMI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-start-page "Windows WMI") in C++

## Usage

Just `#include "winwmi.hpp"` in your code!

### Initialize

To initialize your winwmi you basically should do:

```C++
const auto win_wmi = std::make_unique<WinWmi>(
        L"root\\CIMV2", // WMI Namespace
        L"Win32_Process" // Optional WMI Class
        // Optional WMI Method to set data (ex. L"Set")
    );

if (const auto error = win_wmi->GetLastError(); error != WmiError::kNone)
    throw std::exception(fmt::format("WinWmi Failed with code: {}\n", static_cast<int>(error)).c_str());
```

### Retrieving information from class

```C++
if (auto res = win_wmi->get_all(L"Caption"); res.has_value())
{
    for (const auto& element : res.value())
    {
        fmt::print(L"[WnWMI] Caption: {}\n", element);
    }
} 
```

### WinWmi Errors

WinWmi has got his own error handling which can be accessed via 

```C++
win_wmi->GetLastError()
```

If you want to see what code does mean then you can look in to WmiError enum. Their names should describe what exactly happened and what went wrong.
